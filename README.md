# Deep-Face-Recognition
Embark on a groundbreaking journey into the future of identity verification with our state-of-the-art Deep Face Recognition project. Leveraging the power of Python, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and advanced Deep Learning techniques, this project redefines the standards of facial recognition technology.
Since late 2022, the field has gained widespread attention due to the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT,followed by alternatives such as Microsoft's Copilot and Google's Gemini. Such examples reflect the recent practice of basing such products upon broad foundational large language models, such as GPT-4 or the Gemini language model, that get fine-tuned so as to target specific tasks or applications (i.e., simulating human conversation, in the case of chatbots). Chatbots can also be designed or customized to further target even more specific situations and/or particular subject-matter domains.
